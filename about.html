            <h2 class="resume-section-title">About Me</h2>
            <article class="resume-item">
              <p>For almost my whole life, my great passion has been programming and developing video games. Ever since I was ten and my mom gave me a tattered HTML manual that was so big I could
                barely lift it, I've been using whatever medium I could get my hands on as a way to make my visions a reality. From those humble beginnings to where I am now has been a long road.
                It's only been a few years since I finally decided to throw my hat into the ring, finish my education, make my way into the industry, and realize that I actually had what it took all
                along. If my mom could see me now and see how the encouragement and support she gave me has finally brought me to where I need to be, doing the thing I love, she would be so proud.</p>

              <p>Although video game development has always been my primary career focus, it stems from a general passion for creation. Whether it be a video game, a simulation, or a system, coming
                up with an idea for something and bringing it into reality so I can see it work is what really gets me up in the morning. Even non-computer related pursuits like writing, drawing, and
                model building. I take immense pride in the quality of my work, always striving to take on every project with the most passion I can bring to it. I’m committed to broadening my
                expertise, always eager to embrace new challenges and expand my knowledge.</p>

              <p>With a mind for business, I want to build and grow something innovative, develop solutions that I can take pride in, and make a meaningful impact through technology.
                I believe we all have something unique to offer, and that if we do our best to bring our ideas to life, we can all get our own slice of the American Dream.</p>
